# Alphabet Reduction via PCPP Composition

Input:
$\pi \in \Sigma^n$, and $|\Sigma|$ is large

Goal: $\pi' \in \{0, 1\}^{n'}$, $\pi \simeq \pi'$

Encode each symbol $a\in\Sigma$ with in binary.

Verifier would query both: The binary string $01001... \in \Sigma$, and a prove $\pi_0$

Since PCPP only gives good vs $\epsilon$-far, we can use error correction code $c: \{0, 1\}^{|\Sigma|}\rightarrow \{0, 1\}^{l=O(|\Sigma|)}$
