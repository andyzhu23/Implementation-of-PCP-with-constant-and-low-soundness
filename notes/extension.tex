# Derandomized Parallel Repetition

Take a HDX, take each clique of size $k$ within HDX as a single node, and take the constraints within the clique as a mono constraint. For each pair of cliques, if their intersection of node is greater $\sqrt k$, then we have an edge connecting them to check consistency. This results in a reduction of soundness from high constant to low constant.

# Routing Protocol 

Fix graph $G$ and an arbitrary permutation $\pi$ on $V(G)$.

Vertex $u$ want to send data to $\pi(u)$ using only edges on $G$

## Routing Protocol to PCPs


### regular 2-CSP to 2-CSP on regular bipartite graph

We first reduce input 2-CSP graph $G''$ to a regular bipartite graph $G'$ while preserving gap.

Every vertex $u$ in $G''$ is split into two vertices $(u, 1)\in L$ and $(u, 2) \in R$

For every edge $(u, v)$ in the original graph, we add edge $((u, 1), (v, 2))$ in new graph

We also create enforcement constraints $((u, 1), (u, 2))$ for every vertex $u$ in the original graph.

### from 2-CSP on regular bipartite graph to 2-CSP on arbitrary graph with fault-tolerant routing protocol

We can partition original graph $G'$, a $2k$-regular graphs into $2k$ perfect matchings.

Suppose we begin with 2-CSP $\phi$, and there exists a fault-tolerant routing protocol, then for a constraint $(1, \pi(1))$ we can set the alphabet size to be the size of the routing between $1$ and $\pi(1)$
